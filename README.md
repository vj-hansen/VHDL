# Counter-based e-dice 
CCW1: A counter-based e-dice (due 13 Sep 2019)

The result selection tuple specifies which of the 6 possible results have triple probability, except:
When the cheat input is ‘0’, in which case all results have equal probability
Tuples (000) and (111), in which case all results have equal probability
Push “run” to throw the e-dice, release it to stop
